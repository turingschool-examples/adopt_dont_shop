### Existing database design
![visual-schema.png](https://i.postimg.cc/0ywZgQ1W/visual-schema.png)

## Learning Goals

In this project, students will build upon the code in this repo to create a Pet Adoption Platform. Users will be able to apply to adopt pets, and Admins will be able to approve or reject applications and see statistics for the Shelters, Pets, and Applications in the system.

* Build out CRUD functionality for a many to many relationship
* Use ActiveRecord to write queries that join multiple tables of data together
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
* Validate models and handle sad paths for invalid data input
* Use flash messages to give feedback to the user
* Use partials in views
* Use `within` blocks in tests
* Track user stories using GitHub Projects
* Deploy an application to Heroku

## Check In

During your Check In, you should be prepared to review your database schema for the many to many relationship, your deployment to Heroku, and your GitHub Projects board.

## Rubric

| | **Feature Completeness** | **Rails** | **ActiveRecord** | **Testing and Debugging** | **Project Management** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **4: Exceptional**  | All User Stories 100% complete including all sad paths and edge cases, and some extension work completed | Students implement strategies not discussed in class and can defend their design decisions | At least one ActiveRecord extension is complete | 100% coverage for features and models. A gem that enhances testing effectiveness is implemented (orderly, factorybot, faker, etc). Students can point to multiple examples of edge case testing that are not included in the user stories | GitHub Project board is fully up to date in all checkins and the evaluation. Students create custom cards on the project board to track tasks in addition to user stories.
| **3: Passing** | All stories in the "Deploy", "Apply for Pet(s)", "Database Logic Part 1", and "Approving Applications" sections are completed | Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code with only 1 - 2 infractions. Action View helpers are used to create forms, links, and buttons. Routes and Actions mostly follow RESTful conventions, and student can defend any non restful routes. At least one partial is created and included in at least two different views. Models include validations. Flash messages are used. | ActiveRecord helpers are utilized whenever possible. ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data. No Ruby is used to process data. All queries functional and accurately implemented. | 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. Tests utilize within blocks to target specific areas of a page | Student uses GitHub Project to track all user stories. Project board is mostly up to date in all checkins. Project board is fully up to date at the evaluation |
| **2: Below Expectations** | All stories in the "Deploy", "Apply for Pet(s)", and "Database Logic Part 1" sections are completed |  Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code, but may have more than 2 infractions. Some routes and actions are not restful, and student cannot defend those decisions. Project may fail to include one of the following: a partial that is included in at least two different views, model validations, or use of flash messages. | Ruby is used to process data that could use ActiveRecord instead. Some instances where ActiveRecord helpers are not utilized. Some queries not accurately implemented. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective, or tests do not utilize within blocks | GitHub Project board is not utilized during one of the checkins. Project board is not fully up to date during evaluation.
| **1: Failing** | Students fail to complete "Database Logic Part 1" section | Project fails to include two out of the following: a partial that is included in at least two different views, model validations, or use of flash messages | Ruby is used to process data more often than ActiveRecord. Many cases where ActiveRecord helpers are not utilized. | Below 90% coverage for either features or models. | GitHub projects is not utilized

## Evaluation

Before your evaluation, choose 2 user stories to present. Try to pick user stories that you think will deliver the highest value in terms of feedback from the instructor. 

During the evaluation, you will present your user story:

* Demonstrate the user story on Heroku (or localhost if the feature is not functional in Production)
* Show the test(s) for the user story
* Show all code that implements the user story

# User Stories

## Deploy

```
[ ] done

Deploy your application to Heroku

As a visitor of the site
I will perform all user stories
By visiting the application on Heroku.
Localhost is fine for development, but
the application must be hosted on Heroku.

Use these guides: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails5
```

## Apply for Pet(s)

Visitors to the site will be able to create applications to adopt pets. An application has many pets. Pets can have many applications.

SQL Only Story

For this story, you should write your queries in raw sql. You can use the ActiveRecord find_by_sql method to execute raw sql queries: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#finding-by-sql

Admin Shelters Index

As a visitor
When I visit the admin shelter index ('/admin/shelters')

When I visit the admin shelter index ('/admin/shelters')
Then I see a section for "Shelter's with Pending Applications"
And in this section I see the name of every shelter that has a pending application
```

## Approving Applications

Pets on an application can either be accepted or rejected.

For this set of stories, we will be making routes that begin with '/admin'. This is to indicate that only a user with special privileges should be able to accept or reject pets on an application. Normally, we would want to make sure that a user is logged into an admin account before being able complete any of this workflow, but we will not add any log in or authorization functionality to this project.

Approving a Pet for Adoption

As a visitor
When I visit an admin application show page ('/admin/applications/:id')
For every pet that the application is for, I see a button to approve the application for that specific pet
When I click that button
Then I'm taken back to the admin application show page
And next to the pet that I approved, I do not see a button to approve this pet
And instead I see an indicator next to the pet that they have been approved
```

```
[ ] done

Rejecting a Pet for Adoption

```

```
Approved/Rejected Pets on one Application do not affect other Applications

As a visitor
When there are two applications in the system for the same pet
When I visit the admin application show page for one of the applications
And I approve or reject the pet for that application
When I visit the other application's admin show page
Then I do not see that the pet has been accepted or rejected for that application
And instead I see buttons to approve or reject the pet for this specific application
```

## Completed Applications

Once all pets on an application have been marked either accepted or rejected, then the application is no longer "Pending". If all the pets were accepted, then the application is "Accepted". If one or more pets on the application is rejected, then the entire application is "Rejected".

```
[ ] done

All Pets Accepted on an Application
