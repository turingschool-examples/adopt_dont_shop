As a visitor
When I visit the pet index page
Then I see a link to "Start an Application"
When I click this link
Then I am taken to the new application page where I see a form
When I fill in this form with my:
  - Name
  - Street Address
  - City
  - State
  - Zip Code
And I click submit
Then I am taken to the new application's show page
And I see my Name, address information, and description of why I would make a good home
And I see an indicator that this application is "In Progress"
